## What is Velas?

Velas is the world's fastest EVM blockchain and open-source platform for decentralized projects and applications, processing up to 75,000 transactions per second with instant finality, extremely low fees and Solidity support.

## Velas Advantages

- Solidity Support - Supports all smart contracts built on the Ethereum Blockchain.

    - Support of different Web3 Libraries - We support Web3 libraries of both Solana and Ethereum.

    - Ethereum Web3 (metamask) and Solana Web3 support - Developers can easily deploy existing open source products from Solana and Ethereum on Velas with minimal yet valuable change.

- Low-cost Transactions - Extremely efficient performance at a fraction of the cost ~0.000001$.

- Scalability - Transfer tokens directly between accounts with 50,000+ TPS throughput, with that figure not being a hard limit.

- Developer Support Program - Receive grants to build on Velas alongside marketing and fundraising support.

- Composable - Never deal with multiple shards or layer 2 systems.

## Investment

Investment size could be up to $100,000 per project. The general investment program is designed to fund projects covering a wide range of topics, including, but not limited to:

1. DeFi-related and DEX-related products
2. NFT-related solutions
3. Games and gaming;
    - Educational - games that ease entrance for those not familiar with blockchain technology or background
    - Innovative games uniting blockchain and cryptocurrencies with AI, VR/AR and other high-tech domains. We will support teams and developers who are more experienced in high-tech domains with their development on blockchain.
    - Crypto gamification
    - Other games (strategies, collectibles, card games, etc)
4. dApps that unite the Velas blockchain with traditional sectors - Banking, Healthcare, Manufacturing, etc. We support teams from different domains who use blockchain to solve real business problems
5. Adoption of dApps - solutions that aid the adoption of cryptocurrencies and blockchain on a wide scale.

We also will actively encourage developers on creating solutions that increase decentralization and transparency of the Velas Ecosystem - possibly additional funding via ecosystem fund.

All projects will be tracked on GitHub. Teams can apply for grants more than once, but they need to successfully complete the previous project before receiving additional funds.

*Projects that were chosen for the grant may also receive additional $10,000 funding from AWS per project.*
